# Capstone-
CKME136 

Click fraud is the act of generating fraudulent clicks on pay-per-click advertisements which results in artificially inflating web traffic and potential loss of revenue to the advertiser. 

TalkingData provided a dataset of around 200 million clicks spanning over 4 days for a Kaggle challenge with the aim of building an algorithm for determination of users that will download a mobile application after clicking on a relevant advertisement. This challenge will be the main focus of the research question for this capstone project.  

Techniques for classification analysis will be employed on the R platform (RStudio) to tackle this challenge.
